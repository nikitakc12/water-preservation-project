# ðŸŒŠ Drone-Based Water Conservation & Restoration Project

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
**Objective:** Use drones to support water conservation and restoration projects (rivers, wetlands).  
**Why drones?** They are cost-effective, accurate, and reduce manual labour compared to traditional surveys.

**How this project helps:**
- Capture **orthophotographic images** (accurate 2D aerial maps).
- Generate **3D models** of terrain for planning restoration projects.
- Assist in **designing ditches, basins, wetlands, and vegetation zones**.
- Monitor changes in **water quality, land use, and vegetation** over time.

**Case Study:** Summa River and Savilammi wetland area, Finland.  
**Outcome:** Efficient, accurate, and sustainable water restoration planning.


## ðŸ“Œ Project Scope & Goals
**Scope:** Collect and analyze environmental data using drones and software to support water restoration projects.  

**Goals:**
1. Produce orthophotos (2D maps) and 3D terrain models.  
2. Plan and monitor water restoration structures (ditches, wetlands, vegetation zones).  
3. Document methods, results, challenges, and benefits.  
4. Deliver a final report with images, diagrams, and analysis.
