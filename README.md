Drone-Assisted Water Conservation and Restoration Project
Project Summary

The project focuses on using drones and modern sensor technologies to support water conservation and restoration projects (e.g., rivers, wetlands).

Why drones and sensors?
They are cost-effective, provide accurate and high-resolution data, and reduce manual labour compared to traditional methods. With advanced sensors, drones can detect changes not only in the landscape but also in the water’s chemical and biological composition.

How they help:

Capture orthophotographic images (geometrically corrected 2D aerial maps).

Generate photogrammetric 3D models of the terrain.

Monitor changes in water quality, vegetation, and land use over time.

Detect chemical or biological changes in water using multispectral or hyperspectral sensors.

Collect water samples or perform monitoring automatically without human intervention.

Integrate with IoT devices for continuous data collection in and around water bodies.

Enable predictive modelling of water quality trends using collected data.

Innovative Approaches Proposed:

A networked system where drones and stationary IoT sensors collaborate, sending real-time alerts if pollution, harmful algae, or other anomalies are detected.

Scheduled automated drone flights to capture data and samples at regular intervals, reducing human effort.

Using collected data to create predictive models of water quality trends over time, supporting proactive conservation measures.

Case study: The Summa River and Savilammi wetland area in Finland.

Expected Outcome:
Drones equipped with advanced sensors, combined with IoT integration and automated monitoring, will make restoration projects more efficient, accurate, proactive, and sustainable.
