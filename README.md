# Drone-Based Water Conservation & Restoration Project

## Project Summary

This project focuses on using drones and modern sensor technologies to support water conservation and restoration projects, such as rivers and wetlands.

### Why Drones and Sensors?
- Cost-effective and reduces manual labour.
- Provides high-resolution and accurate data.
- Detects changes not only in the landscape but also in waterâ€™s chemical and biological composition using advanced sensors.

### How They Help
- Capture orthophotographic images (geometrically corrected 2D aerial maps).
- Generate photogrammetric 3D models of the terrain.
- Monitor changes in water quality, vegetation, and land use over time.
- Detect chemical or biological changes in water using multispectral/hyperspectral sensors.
- Collect water samples or perform monitoring automatically without human intervention.
- Integrate with IoT devices for continuous data collection around water bodies.
- Enable predictive modelling of water quality trends using collected data.

### Innovative Approaches Proposed
- **Networked system**: Drones and stationary IoT sensors collaborate, sending real-time alerts if pollution, harmful algae, or other anomalies are detected.
- **Automated drone flights**: Scheduled flights to capture data and samples at regular intervals, reducing human effort.
- **Predictive modelling**: Use collected data to forecast water quality trends over time, supporting proactive conservation measures.


### Expected Outcome
Drones equipped with advanced sensors, combined with IoT integration and automated monitoring, will make restoration projects more efficient, accurate, proactive, and sustainable.
