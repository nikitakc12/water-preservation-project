Drone-Assisted Water Conservation and Restoration Project
Project Overview:

This project explores the use of drones to support water conservation and restoration efforts, focusing on rivers, wetlands, and other critical aquatic ecosystems. Drones are a cost-effective solution that provide accurate data while reducing manual labor compared to traditional aerial surveys.


Why Drones?

Cost-effective and time-saving compared to traditional aerial surveys

Capture high-resolution images and terrain data

Enable precise planning and monitoring of water restoration projects


How Drones Help?

Orthophotographic Images: Geometrically corrected 2D aerial maps for accurate visualization

Photogrammetric 3D Models: Generate detailed 3D terrain models for planning restoration structures

Restoration Planning: Identify locations for ditches, basins, wetlands, and vegetation zones

Monitoring: Track changes in water quality, vegetation health, and land use

Case Study: Summa River and Savilammi Wetland Area, Finland
Outcome: Drone imaging enhances the efficiency, accuracy, and sustainability of water restoration projects
